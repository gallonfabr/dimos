    """Create a raw audio normalizer operator.

    This operator applies dynamic normalization to raw audio events. It tracks
    the maximum volume encountered and normalizes audio to a target level.

    NOTE: This operator only works with RawAudioEvent. Compressed audio is passed
    through unchanged with a warning. For a version that handles any format, use
    the GStreamer-based normalizer operator.

    Args:
        target_level: Target normalization level (0.0 to 1.0, default: 1.0)
        min_volume_threshold: Minimum volume to apply normalization (default: 0.01)
        max_gain: Maximum allowed gain to prevent excessive amplification (default: 10.0)
        decay_factor: Decay factor for max volume (0.0-1.0, higher = slower decay, default: 0.999)
        adapt_speed: How quickly to adapt to new volume levels (0.0-1.0, default: 0.05)
        volume_func: Function to calculate volume (default: calculate_peak_volume)

    Returns:
        An operator function that can be used with pipe()

    Examples:
        # Normalize raw audio from a file
        file_input("audio.wav").pipe(
            raw_normalizer(target_level=0.8),
