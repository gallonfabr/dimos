    """Create an audio resampling operator.

    This operator resamples raw audio to a different sample rate and/or channel count.
    Useful for converting audio to the format required by downstream components.

    NOTE: This operator only works with RawAudioEvent. Compressed audio is passed
    through unchanged with a warning.

    Args:
        target_sample_rate: Target sample rate in Hz (None = no resampling)
        target_channels: Target number of channels (None = no channel conversion)
            - 1: Convert to mono (average all channels)
            - 2: Convert to stereo (duplicate mono, or pass through stereo)

    Returns:
        An operator function that can be used with pipe()

    Examples:
        # Resample to 16kHz mono for WhisperLive
        file_input("audio.wav").pipe(
            resample(target_sample_rate=16000, target_channels=1),
